#RAINFALL PREDICTION USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION

#Project Overview

Rainfall prediction plays an important role in agriculture and weather planning.
This project focuses on predicting whether rainfall will occur or not using Logistic Regression, a classification algorithm.

The project uses historical weather data, applies basic preprocessing, builds a prediction model, and visualizes the results using histograms.

#OBJECTIVES:

This project aims to:

Predict rainfall occurrence using Logistic Regression

Understand model prediction distribution using visualization

Apply machine learning concepts on real-world weather data

#DATASET INFORMATION:

The dataset contains weather-related features such as:

Temperature

Humidity

Wind Speed

Pressure

Rainfall (target variable)

#TECHONOLOGIES USED:

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

#PROJECT WORKFLOW:

Import Libraries

Imported required Python libraries for data handling, modeling, and visualization.

Data Loading

Loaded the rainfall dataset using Pandas.

Data Preparation

Selected relevant features

Converted target variable into binary form

Split dataset into training and testing sets

Model Building (Logistic Regression)

Applied Logistic Regression for rainfall prediction

Trained the model using training data

Generated predictions on test 

#VISUALISATION:

Prediction Distribution

Plotted a histogram to visualize rainfall prediction results.

Insight:
The histogram shows how predicted rainfall and non-rainfall classes are distributed.

#KEY LEARNINGS:

Logistic Regression can be used for binary classification problems

Proper data preparation is crucial for accurate predictions

Histograms help in understanding binary prediction distribution

Machine learning models can be applied to real-world weather data
